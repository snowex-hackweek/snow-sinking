# (Collab)oration Repo Rules ;)

In shared `repos`, try to limit edits to 1 person working in a single notebook at a time. 
Feel free to copy code from someone's notebooks, but try to avoid collaborating in a single Jupyter notebook at the same time. 

If two folks are working in a notebook at the same time and they both push changes, this will cause merge conflicts within the notebook and hurt everyones brains a lot. 

<br />

### The best practices for collaborating in Jupyter Notebooks are, 
- two people working in **seperate** notebooks at the same time
- two people, co-programming in a single notebook via Zoom, where only **1 person** is editing the notebook sharing their screen
- two people *TAKING TURNS* working in a single notebook, by pushing/pulling the notebook updates to/from the `snow-sinking repo` to share their changes

<br />

These are suggestions by Cassie Lumbrazo, based on previous headaches. Feel free to provide any more ideas or hints that you might have. Thanks :)
