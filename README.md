*"This is a super interesting problem, but it's a mess"* - Kelly Elder



### General Project Interest & Direction
#### **Evaluation of snow surface properties on Grand Mesa for wildlife applications in the forest vs. open** 

Snow surface properties such as, 
- snow surface hardness 
- snow surface density 
- cohesion of the top of the snowpack 

#### Including, but not limited to, the following research questions, 
- When and how often is the snowpack denser in the forest vs. the open on Grand Mesa in 2020? 
    - Is this consistent between the other SnowEx timeseries locations? 
    - How well does the top 10 cm (or top 20 cm) density correlate with hardness? 
        - measured by SMP? 
        - measured by pit data, such as crystal properties or hand hardness? 
- What observations provide qualitative data for surface hardness? 
    - How do these different types of observatiosn compare?
